# MuzycznaSzafa

This an iOS and MacOS cross-platform app with CoreData database, localization (Polish + English), extensive unit and UI tests.

It was originally developed for commercial purposes but later the project died so I erased all user data and open-sourced it, so that at least I could
have a nice addition to my portfolio.
